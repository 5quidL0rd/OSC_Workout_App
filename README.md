# OSC Workout

If you like exercising but donâ€™t want to pay the $3 a month that top-tier workout apps charge then this is the project for you. The plan is to design a free OPEN SOURCE mobile app that you can download from a browser (PWA) and run locally on your phone (NO backend for this project). The goal is to implement as many high-quality workout app features as we can. Ideally we will be able to grab data from your other workout apps, allowing you to import your workout history into the OSC app.

### 1. Move into the project folder
